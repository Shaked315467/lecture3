        <p>Lychee, litchi, and lichee all refer to the same tropical fruit that offers healthy vitamins, minerals, and antioxidants. Adding this fruit into your diet is a healthy choice.

            The lychee (Litchi chinensis) — also known as litchi or lichee — is a small tropical fruit from the soapberry family.
            
            Other popular fruits in this family include rambutan and longan.
            
            Lychees are grown in subtropical regions throughout the world and especially popular in their native China, as well as Southeast Asia.
            
            Known for their sweet and flowery flavor, they’re typically eaten fresh and sometimes used in ice creams or processed into juice, wine, sherbert, and jelly.
            
            They’re a good source of several vitamins, minerals, and healthy antioxidants.
            
            Lychees have an inedible, pink-red, leathery skin, which is removed before consumption. The flesh is white and surrounds a dark seed in the center.</p>

       <p> It is a tropical tree native to South China, Malaysia, and northern Vietnam.
        
    The tree has been introduced throughout Southeast Asia and South Asia.
    
    Cultivation in China is documented from the 11th century.
    
    China is the main producer of lychees, followed by Vietnam, India, other countries in Southeast Asia, other countries in the Indian subcontinent, Madagascar, and South Africa.
    
    A tall evergreen tree, it bears small fleshy sweet fruits. The outside of the fruit is a pink-red, rough-textured soft shell.

Lychee seeds contain methylene cyclopropyl glycine which has caused hypoglycemia
associated with outbreaks of encephalopathy in undernourished Indian and Vietnamese children who consumed lychee fruit.
